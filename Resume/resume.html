<!--The website must depict a resume about the student, containing the following features:
    2. Professional objective statement
    
    3. Education

    4. Relevant Work Experience (if no work experience, leave out)
    
    5. Projects
    
    6. Skills
    
    In addition to the main resume page, the website must have 2 additional pages; each will be dedicated to a unique Project.
    Here, the student can choose any 2 projects from any classes they have had in the past, or personal projects they would like to display.
    Each project page should include the following:
        1. A title for the project
        2. An image that illustrates the project
        3. A description of the project
        4. Skills learned from completing the project

    The website’s structure must appropriately use semantic HTML tags; it must minimize the use of non-semantic HTML tags.
